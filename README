I've been writing Python and d3.js scripts to have a little fun with our fantasy baseball league: Python to screen-scrape stats and standings from our ESPN league pages, and d3.js for some of the data visualization.

I'll try to post all of the necessary files here so others can play around with it, too.

If you aren't in the Crazy Rhythms league and have no idea what I'm talking about when I say "Crazy Rhythms," you're more than welcome to the code, but bear in mind much of it is league-specific.
